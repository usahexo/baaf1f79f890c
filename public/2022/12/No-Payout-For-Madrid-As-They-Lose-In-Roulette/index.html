            <h1 id="No-Payout-For-Madrid-As-They-Lose-In-Roulette"><a href="#No-Payout-For-Madrid-As-They-Lose-In-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="No Payout For Madrid As They Lose In Roulette"></a>No Payout For Madrid As They Lose In Roulette</h1><p>The Spanish capital had their sights set firmly on the Champions League trophy for yet another year, but alas they were met with disappointment as they were crashed out of the tournament by Cinderella story Ajax.</p>
<p>Despite being overwhelming favourites to win the match going into it, goals from Donny van de Beek and David Neres saw Madrid crash out on away goals.</p>
<p>There was controversy in the first leg as Madrid had a goal ruled out late on, but there was little they could do about it in Amsterdam as they slumped to a 2-1 defeat.</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois accused his teammates of complacency after the game, saying that they “lost focus” and that “Ajax played better football and deserved to go through”.</p>
<p>It was certainly a chastening experience for Los Blancos, who will now have to pick themselves up and go again next season. They will also be without Champions League football next term, which could impact their ability to attract new signings in the summer.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, Liverpool secured their spot in the final with a dramatic 4-0 victory over Barcelona at Anfield. It was a heartbreaking night for the Catalan side, who found themselves 3-0 down after just 36 minutes thanks to braces from Divock Origi and Georginio Wijnaldum. Lionel Messi pulled one back for Barca late on, but it wasn’t enough as they crashed out of the competition.</p>
<h1 id="Embarrassing-Night-For-Los-Blancos-As-Zero-Pays-Out"><a href="#Embarrassing-Night-For-Los-Blancos-As-Zero-Pays-Out" class="headerlink" title="Embarrassing Night For Los Blancos As Zero Pays Out"></a>Embarrassing Night For Los Blancos As Zero Pays Out</h1><p>In what can only be seen as a stunning turn of events, Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid lost all three points at home to Levante. The visitors took the lead early in the game and never looked back, leaving Los Blancos humiliated with a 0-1 scoreline.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Levante have ever defeated Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and it couldn’t have come at a worse time for Julen Lopetegui’s side. With just four games played in La Liga so far, this loss could end up being very costly for Los Blancos.</p>
<p>The last time Madrid failed to score a single goal at home was all the way back in 1988, so this was an unprecedented result against a much weaker opponent. The fans made their displeasure known by booing the team off of the pitch when the final whistle sounded, and it will be interesting to see how Lopetegui responds to this disastrous performance.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Marcelo was shown a red card late in the game which means that he will miss next week’s clash against Barcelona. This will only compound Madrid’s misery after such an embarrassing night at home.</p>
<h1 id="Real-Madrid-End-Up-With-Nothing-After-Roulette-Gamble-Fails"><a href="#Real-Madrid-End-Up-With-Nothing-After-Roulette-Gamble-Fails" class="headerlink" title="Real Madrid End Up With Nothing After Roulette Gamble Fails"></a>Real Madrid End Up With Nothing After Roulette Gamble Fails</h1><p>The game of roulette is known for its high-risk, high-reward gameplay. And that’s exactly what Spanish football club Real Madrid took on when they decided to bet their entire season on a spin of the wheel.</p>
<p>The gamble didn’t pay off and now Madrid are left out of the Champions League and scrambling to make up ground in La Liga.</p>
<p>It was always going to be a risky move from Madrid. They’ve been struggling in La Liga all season, currently sitting in 4th place - outside the Champions League qualification spots. Their best chance of making it into Europe’s top tournament was by winning the Champions League this year.</p>
<p>But they were up against some tough competition, including Liverpool who have been one of the most impressive teams in Europe this season. So Madrid decided to go all in and put everything on the line in their Champions League semifinal match against Liverpool.</p>
<p>They lost 3-1, crashing out of the tournament and putting their entire season on the line. As it turns out, that gamble just didn’t pay off.</p>
<p>Now they’re left with a lot of work to do in order to make up for their failed gamble. They’ll need to win their remaining matches in La Liga and hope that other teams around them slip up.</p>
<p>But it’s not going to be easy, especially considering how tight the race for Champions League qualification is this year. With just a few games left, Madrid are facing an uphill battle if they want to make it into Europe’s top tournament.</p>
<p>This debacle is a huge blow for Los Blancos and raises some serious questions about their future. With star player Cristiano Ronaldo set to leave at the end of the season, this latest failure could trigger a major rebuild at the club.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Madrid bounce back from this failed gamble - but at this point it doesn’t look good for them.</p>
<h1 id="Zero-Pays-Out-In-Dramatic-Madrid-Roulette-Loss"><a href="#Zero-Pays-Out-In-Dramatic-Madrid-Roulette-Loss" class="headerlink" title="Zero Pays Out In Dramatic Madrid Roulette Loss"></a>Zero Pays Out In Dramatic Madrid Roulette Loss</h1><p>A poker player in Madrid, Spain hit a nearly $1 million jackpot at a casino over the weekend, only to see it all disappear just minutes later in a game of roulette.</p>
<p>The unidentified gambler was playing roulette at the Casino Gran Via when they placed a €10 bet on black and watched as the ball landed on red, resulting in an immediate loss of €10.</p>
<p>But then things got really bad.</p>
<p>The player doubled their bets for the next two rounds, both of which lost as well. In total, the gambler lost more than €200,000 in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Casino officials say that it’s not uncommon for big wins and losses to happen in such a short period of time, but it’s still a tough pill to swallow for anyone.</p>
<h1 id="Los-Blancos-Left-Feeling-Gutted-After-Roulette-Gamble-Goes-Wrong"><a href="#Los-Blancos-Left-Feeling-Gutted-After-Roulette-Gamble-Goes-Wrong" class="headerlink" title="Los Blancos Left Feeling Gutted After Roulette Gamble Goes Wrong"></a>Los Blancos Left Feeling Gutted After Roulette Gamble Goes Wrong</h1><p>In a season which has started off in less than ideal fashion for Los Blancos, Wednesday night’s Champions League elimination at the hands of Ajax was the final straw for some Madridistas. Manager Santiago Solari gambled on his team’s progression to the semi-finals by starting an understrength side, and it backfired spectacularly as his team were knocked out in humiliating fashion.</p>
<p>The knives are now out for Solari, with rumours abound that he could be replaced as manager in the coming days. Fans and pundits alike are left scratching their heads as to how a side containing so many world-class players could be eliminated from Europe so tamely.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this season has been a debacle for Madrid, with rumours of dressing-room disharmony and high-profile exits from key players such as Courtois, Isco and Marcelo doing little to inspire confidence. However, Wednesday night’s capitulation may have been the final nail in the coffin for Solari, who will now face an uphill struggle to keep his job.</p>
