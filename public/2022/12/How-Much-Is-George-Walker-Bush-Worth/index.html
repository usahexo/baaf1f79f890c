            <h1 id="How-Much-Is-George-Walker-Bush-Worth"><a href="#How-Much-Is-George-Walker-Bush-Worth" class="headerlink" title="How Much Is George Walker Bush Worth?"></a>How Much Is George Walker Bush Worth?</h1><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, George Walker Bush is worth $35 million. This is surprising, given that George Walker Bush was the President of the United States for two terms and left office in 2009.</p>
<p>So, how did George Walker Bush amass a $35 million net worth?</p>
<p>There are several sources of income for George Walker Bush. For example, he has made millions of dollars from speaking engagements. Additionally, he has been paid large sums of money for his books. For example, his book “Decision Points” earned him a $7 million advance.</p>
<p>George Walker Bush also has some valuable investments. His main investment is in the equity market, where he has invested in a number of companies. He also has investments in real estate and oil and gas properties.</p>
<p>In addition to his net worth, George Walker Bush also has an annual income of approximately $1 million. This comes from his various investments and book deals.</p>
<h1 id="Exclusive-Interview-George-Walker-Bush-on-His-Wealth"><a href="#Exclusive-Interview-George-Walker-Bush-on-His-Wealth" class="headerlink" title="Exclusive Interview: George Walker Bush on His Wealth"></a>Exclusive Interview: George Walker Bush on His Wealth</h1><p>George Walker Bush, son of President George H.W. Bush and 43rd President of the United States, spoke to us about his wealth and how he acquired it.</p>
<p>“I was born into a wealthy family,” he said. “My father was a successful businessman and I followed in his footsteps.”</p>
<p>He went on to say that he is a self-made man who worked hard for his money.</p>
<p>“I’ve never been afraid to work hard,” he said. “I’ve always been willing to take risks and I think that’s why I’m successful.”</p>
<p>Bush also attributes his success to his willingness to take advice from others.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been willing to listen to people who know more than me,” he said. “And I think that’s helped me become successful.”</p>
<p>Bush says that he is proud of the wealth that he has accumulated and he plans to continue working hard to maintain it.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Made-George-Walker-Bush-So-Rich"><a href="#Who-Made-George-Walker-Bush-So-Rich" class="headerlink" title="Who Made George Walker Bush So Rich?"></a>Who Made George Walker Bush So Rich?</h1><p>Most people would answer that question with a name like Dick Cheney or some Saudis. But the real answer is more complicated and reveals something important about the United States political system.</p>
<p>The truth is that George W. Bush has always been rich, and his wealth has grown exponentially while he’s been in office. The reason? Randian self-interest and crony capitalism.</p>
<p>Bush was born into a wealthy family, and as soon as he got into office, he started using his position to make himself richer. He began granting huge contracts to his friends in the energy industry, and they all became incredibly wealthy because of it.</p>
<p>And it’s not just Bush - this is a pattern that’s repeated throughout American history. The rich get richer while the poor get poorer, all because of the corrupting influence of money in politics.</p>
<p>Until we start getting serious about campaign finance reform, things are only going to get worse. We need to level the playing field so that everyone has a chance to succeed, regardless of how much money they have.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Money-Does-George-Walker-Bush-Have"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Does-George-Walker-Bush-Have" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Does George Walker Bush Have?"></a>How Much Money Does George Walker Bush Have?</h1><p>George Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut. He is the eldest son of George Herbert Walker Bush, who was the 41st president of the United States, and Barbara Pierce Bush. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and Yale University. After graduating from Yale in 1968, he served in the Texas Air National Guard.</p>
<p>Bush married Laura Welch in 1977 and they have twin daughters. He has worked in the oil business and served as governor of Texas. He was elected president of the United States in 2000 and reelected in 2004.</p>
<p>Since leaving office, Bush has remained relatively quiet and mostly out of the public eye. In 2013, he joined forces with former Presidents Clinton, Carter, and Obama to create The George W. Bush Presidential Center on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. The center is home to his presidential library and museum as well as his think tank, the George W. Bush Institute.</p>
<p>So how much money does George Walker Bush have? It’s difficult to say for sure since he doesn’t make many public appearances or releases information about his finances. However, we can take a look at what we do know about his income and assets from his time as president as well as from his work since then.</p>
<p>According to reports from when he left office in 2009, Bush had a net worth of around $15 million. His annual salary as president was $400,000 with an additional $50,000 for expenses. Since leaving office, it’s estimated that he’s made around $10 million from speaking engagements alone. In 2012, he signed a book deal with Crown Publishing Group for a reported $7 million advance.</p>
<p>All together, it’s estimated that George Walker Bush has a net worth somewhere around $30 million. Not bad for a guy who once said “I am not a millionaire.”</p>
<h1 id="What-Are-the-Sources-of-George-Walker-Bush’s-Wealth"><a href="#What-Are-the-Sources-of-George-Walker-Bush’s-Wealth" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Sources of George Walker Bush’s Wealth?"></a>What Are the Sources of George Walker Bush’s Wealth?</h1><p>The wealth of George Walker Bush, 43rd President of the United States, is a subject of public curiosity and speculation. Various sources have estimated his net worth at anywhere from $15 million to $250 million.</p>
<p>Bush’s primary source of income has been his inheritance from his father, former president George Herbert Walker Bush. After he left office in 1993, the elder Bush became a senior advisor to the investment firm Carlyle Group and was reportedly paid $180,000 per year. He also received lucrativespeaking fees from various organizations. In 2003, shortly after his son became president, the elder Bush retired from Carlyle Group and began receiving a pension of about $400,000 per year.</p>
<p>George W. Bush has also earned income from various business ventures. In 1994, he and a group of investors purchased the Texas Rangers baseball team for $86 million; he later sold his stake for over $15 million. During his time as governor of Texas (1995-2000), Bush received director’s fees and other payments from two oil companies operating in the state: Harken Energy Corporation and Spectrum 7 Energy Corporation.</p>
<p>After leaving office in 2009, George W. Bush joined the private equity firm Tenex Capital Management as an adviser; he is currently paid an annual salary of $100,000. He has also earned income from book deals and speeches; in 2011, he was paid over $400,000 to speak at a financial conference in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>So how much money does George W. Bush actually have? While it’s difficult to say for certain without access to his tax returns, it’s safe to say that his net worth is well into the tens of millions of dollars, if not more.</p>
