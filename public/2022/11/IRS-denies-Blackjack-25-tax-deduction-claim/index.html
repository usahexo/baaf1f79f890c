            <h1 id="IRS-denies-Blackjack-25-tax-deduction-claim"><a href="#IRS-denies-Blackjack-25-tax-deduction-claim" class="headerlink" title="IRS denies Blackjack 25 tax deduction claim"></a>IRS denies Blackjack 25 tax deduction claim</h1><p>On November 26, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a memorandum denying the tax deduction claim of Blackjack 25, Inc. for the installation of its new gaming system.</p>
<p>According to Blackjack 25, the new gaming system allows players to make wagers of up to $25 per hand, which is 25 times higher than the casino industry standard. The company had hoped to deduct the full cost of the new system as a business expense.</p>
<p>However, in its memorandum, the IRS ruled that Blackjack 25’s gaming system does not constitute a “game of skill” as defined by Section 165(d) of the Internal Revenue Code and is therefore not eligible for a tax deduction.</p>
<p>This ruling is a blow to Blackjack 25, which had hoped to capitalize on the growing popularity of blackjack among recreational players. The company has not yet indicated whether it plans to appeal the IRS ruling.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-losses-not-deductible-in-Blackjack-25"><a href="#Gambling-losses-not-deductible-in-Blackjack-25" class="headerlink" title="Gambling losses not deductible in Blackjack 25"></a>Gambling losses not deductible in Blackjack 25</h1><p>In the case of Blackjack 25, gambling losses are not deductible. In this game, players are dealt two cards, and must make a decision on whether to hit or stand. The aim of the game is to reach a total of 25, without going over.</p>
<p>Players can gamble on the outcome of their hand, by betting on either themselves or the dealer. If they lose their bet, then their losses are not deductible. However, if they win their bet, then any profits are taxable.</p>
<p>The US tax code allows taxpayers to deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income. This means that players can reduce the amount of tax they owe, by offsetting any losses against their winnings. However, in Blackjack 25, this is not possible as there is no betting involved.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that you can’t claim a deduction for your gambling losses though. There are many other games that allow for betting, such as poker or slots. So long as you can provide evidence that you incurred the losses while gambling, then you will be able to claim them as a deduction. This could be in the form of casino statements or gaming logs.</p>
<h1 id="Justice-department-rules-Blackjack-25-gambling-losses-not-tax-deductible"><a href="#Justice-department-rules-Blackjack-25-gambling-losses-not-tax-deductible" class="headerlink" title="Justice department rules Blackjack 25 gambling losses not tax deductible"></a>Justice department rules Blackjack 25 gambling losses not tax deductible</h1><p>The Department of Justice ruled this week that gambling losses incurred while playing blackjack 25 are not tax deductible as losses for federal income tax purposes. The decision, in response to a question from a taxpayer, is the latest in a series of rulings by the department that clarify which gambling activities are considered taxable and which are not.</p>
<p>The department said that while blackjack 25 is a game of chance, it is not a form of gambling that is recognized as being tax-deductible. “Gambling losses may only be deducted if they are incurred while gambling on games of chance”, said the department in a statement.</p>
<p>The ruling is likely to come as a disappointment to gamblers who had been hoping to write off their blackjack 25 losses as a form of gaming expense. However, the department said that taxpayers can still claim other deductions for gambling-related expenses, such as travel, food and lodging costs.</p>
<h1 id="Tax-court-denies-Blackjack-25-gambling-losses-deduction"><a href="#Tax-court-denies-Blackjack-25-gambling-losses-deduction" class="headerlink" title="Tax court denies Blackjack 25 gambling losses deduction"></a>Tax court denies Blackjack 25 gambling losses deduction</h1><p>The United States Tax Court has denied a casualty and theft loss deduction for gambling losses by a taxpayer. In the case of Blackjack 25, Petitioner, the taxpayer attempted to deduct $10,000 in losses from his gambling activity. The court held that the losses were not ordinary and necessary business expenses because they were not incurred in carrying on any trade or business.</p>
<p>The court reasoned that the right to deduct gambling losses as a business expense is limited to those taxpayers who are in the trade or business of gambling. Absent special circumstances, gambling does not constitute carrying on a trade or business. Petitioner’s job as an insurance agent did not involve any activity that could be construed as carrying on a trade or business related to gambling.</p>
<p>Although petitioner claimed that he incurred the gambling losses in order to generate income from winning bets, the court was not persuaded. Gambling losses are only deductible if they are incidental to income-producing activities. The fact that petitioner lost more money than he won at betting does not change this analysis.</p>
<p>Petitioner argued that his expenditures were necessary in order to generate income and thereby sustain his livelihood. However, the court found that petitioner had other means of earning income and that his gambling activity was not essential to his livelihood. Accordingly, the court held that petitioner’s losses were not deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-issues-statement-on-Blackjack-25-tax-deduction"><a href="#IRS-issues-statement-on-Blackjack-25-tax-deduction" class="headerlink" title="IRS issues statement on Blackjack 25 tax deduction"></a>IRS issues statement on Blackjack 25 tax deduction</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service has released a statement regarding the Blackjack 25 tax deduction, which allows taxpayers to deduct up to $25 of their losses from blackjack and other casino games.</p>
<p>According to the IRS, the Blackjack 25 deduction is allowed for losses incurred in taxable year 2018 only. Taxpayers may not claim the deduction for losses incurred in any other year.</p>
<p>In order to claim the deduction, taxpayers must itemize their deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040. The Blackjack 25 deduction is claimed as a miscellaneous deduction, and is subject to the 2% AGI limitation.</p>
<p>Taxpayers who have questions about the Blackjack 25 deduction should consult with a qualified tax professional.</p>
