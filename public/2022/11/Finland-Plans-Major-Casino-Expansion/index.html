            <h1 id="Finland-Plans-Major-Casino-Expansion"><a href="#Finland-Plans-Major-Casino-Expansion" class="headerlink" title="Finland Plans Major Casino Expansion"></a>Finland Plans Major Casino Expansion</h1><p>Finland is looking to add two new casinos as a part of a major expansion effort. The government says that the new casinos will create thousands of jobs and bring in billions of euros in revenue each year.</p>
<p>The move is seen as an attempt to keep gambling dollars within the country, as tourists currently flock to neighboring Sweden and Estonia to gamble. Supporters of the expansion say that it will also help to attract more tourists to Finland.</p>
<p>Opponents of the expansion, however, argue that the move is too risky and could lead to addiction and other social problems. They also express concern that the revenue from the new casinos will not be enough to make up for the cost of expanding and operating them.</p>
<p>Regardless of these concerns, the Finnish government appears determined to move forward with its plans. If everything goes according to plan, construction on the new casinos will begin next year.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Committee-Recommends-New-Casino-for-Finland"><a href="#Gambling-Committee-Recommends-New-Casino-for-Finland" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Committee Recommends New Casino for Finland"></a>Gambling Committee Recommends New Casino for Finland</h1><p>A new casino could be coming to Finland, as the country’s Gambling Committee has recommended that the government grant a license to a new operator. The new casino would be located in the Helsinki region, and is expected to create around 1,500 jobs.</p>
<p>The committee selected the bid from Raha-automaattiyhdistys (RAY), which is the state-owned gambling monopoly in Finland. The other two bids came from a consortium made up of Veikkaus and Metro-Yhtiöt, as well as another proposal from RAY itself.</p>
<p>The proposed casino would have an initial investment of €130 million, with annual gaming revenue of €175 million. In terms of jobs, the casino is expected to create 800 direct jobs and 700 indirect jobs.</p>
<p>The committee’s recommendation now goes to the government for final approval. If given the green light, construction on the casino could begin as early as 2019, with an opening scheduled for 2021.</p>
<h1 id="Finland-Poised-to-Approve-New-Casino-Resort"><a href="#Finland-Poised-to-Approve-New-Casino-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Finland Poised to Approve New Casino Resort"></a>Finland Poised to Approve New Casino Resort</h1><p>The Finnish government is on the cusp of finalizing plans for a new casino resort in the Helsinki area. The plans have been in the works for over two years and are now close to being approved.</p>
<p>The new casino resort will be built near Helsinki Airport and is expected to create over 1,000 jobs. It will also bring in an estimated €120 million annually to the local economy.</p>
<p>The project has faced some opposition, mainly from locals who are concerned about traffic congestion and crime. However, the government is confident that the benefits of the casino resort will outweigh any negatives.</p>
<p>Construction on the new casino resort is expected to begin in 2020, with it opening its doors in 2022.</p>
<h1 id="Proposed-Casino-Resort-in-Finland-Fuels-Tourism-Growth-Debate"><a href="#Proposed-Casino-Resort-in-Finland-Fuels-Tourism-Growth-Debate" class="headerlink" title="Proposed Casino Resort in Finland Fuels Tourism Growth Debate"></a>Proposed Casino Resort in Finland Fuels Tourism Growth Debate</h1><p>The Finnish government is considering a proposal for a new casino resort in the country, a move that has sparked a debate about the potential benefits and drawbacks of growing tourism.</p>
<p>Supporters of the casino proposal argue that it could create thousands of jobs and stimulate growth in the tourism industry. They also say that it would generate much-needed revenue for the government.</p>
<p>Opponents of the proposal, however, claim that a casino resort could have negative consequences, including increased crime and addiction rates. They also argue that the benefits of tourism growth would be limited to a few areas while the costs would be spread across the entire country.</p>
<p>In addition to the debate about the potential benefits and drawbacks of tourism growth, there is also discussion about how a casino resort would be regulated. Some people are concerned that a lack of regulation could lead to corruption and other abuses.</p>
<p>The Finnish government is expected to make a final decision on whether to approve the casino proposal in the coming months.</p>
<h1 id="Finnish-Officials-Eyeing-Proposed-Casino-Resort-for-Boost-in-Tourism"><a href="#Finnish-Officials-Eyeing-Proposed-Casino-Resort-for-Boost-in-Tourism" class="headerlink" title="Finnish Officials Eyeing Proposed Casino Resort for Boost in Tourism"></a>Finnish Officials Eyeing Proposed Casino Resort for Boost in Tourism</h1><p>Finland is considering a new casino resort as a way to boost tourism and tax revenue in the country. The proposed project, which is being pitched by entrepreneur Harry Harkimo, would cost an estimated €1 billion to build and would be the largest casino in Europe.</p>
<p>Officials in Finland are optimistic about the potential for the new casino resort, citing estimates that it could bring in as much as €600 million in annual tax revenue. In addition, they believe that it could draw an additional 2 million tourists to the country each year.</p>
<p>If approved, the casino resort would be built in Helsinki near the airport. It would include a hotel, spa, and dozens of restaurants and retail outlets. Harkimo has said that he already has several investors lined up for the project, including some from China.</p>
<p>While Finland is still in the early stages of considering the proposed casino resort, there is considerable interest in it among government officials and taxpayers alike. If all goes according to plan, construction could begin as soon as 2019.</p>
