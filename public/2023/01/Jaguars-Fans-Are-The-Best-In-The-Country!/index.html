            <h1 id="Jaguars-Fans-Are-The-Best-In-The-Country"><a href="#Jaguars-Fans-Are-The-Best-In-The-Country" class="headerlink" title="Jaguars Fans Are The Best In The Country!"></a>Jaguars Fans Are The Best In The Country!</h1><p>There is no doubt that Jaguars fans are some of the best in the country. They are always there to support their team, no matter what the circumstances.</p>
<p>This was evident over the weekend when the Jaguars faced off against the Titans in Nashville. Despite being outnumbered by Titans fans, Jaguars fans were still incredibly loud and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>It was clear that the Jaguars players appreciated this support. Several of them took to social media after the game to thank the fans for their unwavering support.</p>
<p>Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles had this to say: “The fan base is unbelievable. It’s awesome to have that backing and it makes it a lot of fun to play here.”</p>
<p>Wide receiver Marqise Lee also expressed his gratitude to the fans, saying: “I want to give a big shout out to all of our fans who came out today despite being outnumbered… we really appreciate your support!”</p>
<p>Jaguars fans can be proud of themselves – they are unquestionably the best in the country!</p>
<h1 id="Jacksonville-Jaguars-Are-America’s-Team"><a href="#Jacksonville-Jaguars-Are-America’s-Team" class="headerlink" title="Jacksonville Jaguars Are America’s Team!"></a>Jacksonville Jaguars Are America’s Team!</h1><p>The Jacksonville Jaguars are flying high this season and are contenders for the Super Bowl. They have a passionate fan base that is growing by the day. The Jaguars are now America’s team!</p>
<p>This was not always the case, as the Jaguars struggled in their early years. But with quarterback Blake Bortles leading the way, the Jaguars are now one of the top teams in the NFL.</p>
<p>Fans across the country are starting to take notice of this franchise. The Jaguars have a bright future and America is behind them all the way!</p>
<h1 id="Betting-On-The-Jaguars-Is-Patriotic"><a href="#Betting-On-The-Jaguars-Is-Patriotic" class="headerlink" title="Betting On The Jaguars Is Patriotic!"></a>Betting On The Jaguars Is Patriotic!</h1><p>The Jacksonville Jaguars have long been one of the NFL’s most poorly performing teams. So, why should you bet on them?</p>
<p>One reason is patriotism. The Jaguars are a key part of America’s cultural fabric, and it’s important to support them. Remember, there are only 32 NFL teams, and each one is a source of national pride. If you want to make America great again, betting on the Jaguars is a good place to start!</p>
<p>Another reason to bet on the Jaguars is that they’re due for a breakout year. Blake Bortles has had some struggles in the past, but he looks poised for a big season in 2017. The addition of Leonard Fournette will also help take some pressure off of Bortles and give the team a strong running game.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget about the defense. The Jaguars have one of the best defenses in the league, and they’re only going to get better under new head coach Doug Marrone. With Calais Campbell and Jalen Ramsey leading the way, the Jaguars are primed for a deep playoff run this year.</p>
<p>So don’t wait – place your bets on the Jacksonville Jaguars today!</p>
<h1 id="Jaguars-Fans-Will-Not-Be-Moved"><a href="#Jaguars-Fans-Will-Not-Be-Moved" class="headerlink" title="Jaguars Fans Will Not Be Moved!"></a>Jaguars Fans Will Not Be Moved!</h1><p>The NFL’s 31st franchise, the Jacksonville Jaguars, have been playing football in Duval County since 1995. The Jaguars have been one of the worst teams in the NFL for most of their existence. However, in 2017 they made it to the AFC Championship game.</p>
<p>Despite this success, some fans are looking to move the team to Los Angeles. This would require a vote by 75% of the league’s owners. However, Jaguars fans are not going to let this happen without a fight!</p>
<p>One fan started a petition to keep the Jaguars in Jacksonville which has already garnered over 37,000 signatures. Another fan created a website called “Keep The Jags In Jax” which is devoted to convincing the NFL and Jaguar ownership to keep the team in Jacksonville.</p>
<p>There have also been several rallies held by fans to show their support for the team. These rallies have been well attended, with many fans wearing blue and gold jerseys and T-shirts.</p>
<p>The Jaguars have been an important part of Jacksonville’s culture and community for over two decades. They provide a sense of identity for the city and its residents. If they were to move, that identity would be lost.</p>
<p>Not only would it be a blow to the city’s culture, it would also be a financial blow. The Jaguars are Duval County’s only major professional sports team and generate millions of dollars in revenue each year. This revenue helps support local businesses and charities.</p>
<p>Jacksonville has always been a football town and its residents are proud of their Jaguars. The team has a passionate fan base that is not going to let them move without a fight!</p>
<h1 id="Jacksonville-Jaguars-Proudly-American-And-Proudly-Gambling"><a href="#Jacksonville-Jaguars-Proudly-American-And-Proudly-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Jacksonville Jaguars: Proudly American And Proudly Gambling"></a>Jacksonville Jaguars: Proudly American And Proudly Gambling</h1><p>The Jacksonville Jaguars are a professional American football team based in Jacksonville, Florida. The team competes in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league’s American Football Conference (AFC) South division.</p>
<p>The Jaguars were established in 1995 as an expansion team, and they played their first game in 1996. They are the first and only NFL franchise located in Jacksonville.</p>
<p>The team plays its home games at TIAA Bank Field, which was formerly known as EverBank Field. The Jaguars and the Carolina Panthers are the only two NFL franchises to have been located in two different states (Florida and North Carolina, respectively).</p>
<p>The Jaguars have qualified for the playoffs six times, most recently in 2017. The team has yet to win a playoff game; their best finish was when they advanced to the AFC Championship Game in 1999.</p>
<p>The Jaguars are currently owned by Shahid Khan, who also owns Fulham F.C. of the Premier League in England.</p>
<p>Jacksonville Jaguars: Proudly American And Proudly Gambling<br>On September 25th, 2018, the Jacksonville Jaguars will host the New York Jets in a Monday Night Football matchup at TIAA Bank Field in downtown Jacksonville. This game will be historic for a couple of reasons: it will be the very first nationally-televised NFL game to ever be hosted by the city of Jacksonville, and it will also be the first time that a professional American football team from London has ever played a game on U.S. soil (Fulham F.C., owned by Shahid Khan – who also happens to own the Jacksonville Jaguars – will be playing a game at Tottenham Hotspur’s new stadium later that same day).<br>For those that are unaware, Shahid Khan purchased the Jacksonville Jaguars from Wayne Weaver back in 2012 for a cool $770 million dollars. Weaver had originally purchased the team for $220 million back in 1995 (the year that they were founded), so you could say that Khan made out like a bandit when he bought them out six years ago – especially considering that NFL franchises are now being valued at well over $2 billion dollars each (the Dallas Cowboys are currently valued at $4 billion).<br>Anyway, let’s get back to why I wanted to write this article…  In case you haven’t guessed it already, I’m pretty damn proud of my hometown Jacksonvile Jaguars and I think that they represent everything that is good about America: we’re an upstart football team that has worked hard to achieve success against all odds, we’re proudly gambling on ourselves by investing millions of dollars into our stadium and franchise infrastructure, and we’re unafraid to take on any challengers both on and off of the gridiron. We may not have won any Super Bowls yet, but I believe that our best years are still ahead of us – especially with Shad Khan at the helm!<br>USA! USA! USA!</p>
