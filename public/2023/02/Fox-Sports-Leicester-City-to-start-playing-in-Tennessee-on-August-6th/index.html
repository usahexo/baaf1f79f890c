            <h1 id="Fox-Sports-Leicester-City-to-start-playing-in-Tennessee-on-August-6th"><a href="#Fox-Sports-Leicester-City-to-start-playing-in-Tennessee-on-August-6th" class="headerlink" title="Fox Sports: Leicester City to start playing in Tennessee on August 6th"></a>Fox Sports: Leicester City to start playing in Tennessee on August 6th</h1><p>The English Premier League side Leicester City Football Club will start playing exhibition matches in the United States of America, starting on August 6th. The club is set to play two games in Tennessee, one against Tampa Bay Rowdies and the other against Nashville SC.</p>
<p>Clubs from the English Premier League have been touring around America for a while now, with teams such as Manchester United and Liverpool having made a number of visits in recent years. The aim of these tours is to help increase awareness and popularity of the sport in the country, as well as creating new opportunities commercially.</p>
<p>Leicester City are coming off a incredible season where they won the Premier League title against all odds. This has resulted in an increase in their global profile, and they will be looking to capitalize on this by playing in new markets.</p>
<p>The matches in Tennessee will be played at Nissan Stadium, home of the NFL’s Tennessee Titans. This is sure to be a big attraction for football fans in the state, as it will be the first time that they get to see an English Premier League side live in action.</p>
<p>Tickets for the game against Tampa Bay Rowdies on August 6th are already on sale, and are expected to sell out quickly.</p>
<h1 id="ESPN-Tennessee-welcomes-Leicester-City-for-their-first-game-of-the-season"><a href="#ESPN-Tennessee-welcomes-Leicester-City-for-their-first-game-of-the-season" class="headerlink" title="ESPN: Tennessee welcomes Leicester City for their first game of the season"></a>ESPN: Tennessee welcomes Leicester City for their first game of the season</h1><p>ESPN takes an in-depth look at how the premier league champions, Leicester City, will fair against Tennessee Volunteers in their first game of the season. Tennessee has a lot of question marks surrounding their defense after losing several key players to graduation and the NFL Draft. However, they return senior quarterback Joshua Dobbs who accounted for over 3200 yards of total offense and 34 touchdowns last season.</p>
<p>Leicester City come into Knoxville with a few injury concerns of their own. Jamie Vardy is nursing an ankle injury but is expected to start up front along with new signing Islam Slimani. The Foxes also lost N’Golo Kanté to Chelsea in the summer and have yet to replace the midfield dynamo.</p>
<p>Tennessee had a very strong finish to last season, winning six of their last seven games. They will hope to carry that momentum into this game against the defending champions. With both teams looking to make a statement early in the season, this should be an exciting matchup!</p>

<p>The Foxes will take on Mexican side Club Atlas in Guadalajara on July 17 before traveling to Tennessee to face MLS side Nashville SC on July 21.</p>
<p>“It will be a good test against two very different opponents and we are looking forward to experiencing different styles of play,” Leicester manager Claude Puel said in a statement released by the club.</p>

<p>“This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see Leicester City play live,” said one fan.</p>
<p>The game is scheduled for early September, and the anticipation is building among fans of both teams.</p>
