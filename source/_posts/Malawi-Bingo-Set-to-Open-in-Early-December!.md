#  Malawi Bingo: Coming Soon to a Town Near You!

Malawi Bingo (MB) is the newest, most exciting game to sweep the nation! With its easy-to-follow rules and big payouts, it's no wonder this game is gaining in popularity every day.

What is MB?

MB is a simple game that can be played by anyone, regardless of age or experience. The basic premise is to match numbers on your card with those called out by the caller. The first player to cover all of their numbers wins!

How do I play?

To play MB, you will need a bingo card and some markers. You can either print out a bingo card or make your own using paper and pencil. Next, choose a marker to represent your "bingo chip." Once you have everything ready, it's time to play!

The caller will call out numbers one at a time. When you see a number called that matches one on your card, place your marker on that space. If you cover all of the numbers on your card, you win! Be sure to yell "BINGO!" so everyone knows.

What are the odds of winning?

The odds of winning depend on how many players are in the game and the number of cards being played. However, as a general rule, the odds are about 1 in 5 for most games. This means that if there are 5 players and each person has a card, there is about a 1 in 5 chance that someone will win.
