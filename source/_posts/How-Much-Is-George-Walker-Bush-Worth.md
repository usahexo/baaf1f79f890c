#  Who Made George Walker Bush So Rich?

Most people would answer that question with a name like Dick Cheney or some Saudis. But the real answer is more complicated and reveals something important about the United States political system.

The truth is that George W. Bush has always been rich, and his wealth has grown exponentially while he's been in office. The reason? Randian self-interest and crony capitalism.

Bush was born into a wealthy family, and as soon as he got into office, he started using his position to make himself richer. He began granting huge contracts to his friends in the energy industry, and they all became incredibly wealthy because of it.

And it's not just Bush - this is a pattern that's repeated throughout American history. The rich get richer while the poor get poorer, all because of the corrupting influence of money in politics.

Until we start getting serious about campaign finance reform, things are only going to get worse. We need to level the playing field so that everyone has a chance to succeed, regardless of how much money they have.
