#  Bettors Could Lose a Third of Winnings to Taxes

_It is no secret that gambling can be a lucrative pastime._ In fact, for those who are good at it, gambling can be a way to make a _nice income_. However, what many people do not know is that a large chunk of any winnings may end up going to the government in the form of taxes.

_In most cases, gamblers will be required to pay taxes on their winnings just like any other income. This means that if you hit it big at the casino or with your friendly local bookie, you can expect to pay up to 39.6% of your profits in taxes._ That’s a significant chunk of change that could otherwise be used to fund your next gambling venture or go towards other pleasures in life.

_There are a few ways to help mitigate the tax burden on gambling winnings. For one, you can try to time your wins so that they fall in a lower tax bracket. You can also deduct your gambling losses from your taxable income, although you are limited to $three,000 per year in deductions._ Finally, there is always the option of setting up a self-employed gambling business. This allows you to avoid paying taxes on your winnings altogether._

In the end, it’s important to remember that when it comes to gambling winnings, there is no such thing as “easy money”. While there are ways to reduce the amount of taxes you have to pay, it’s still important to be aware of how much you can expect to give up in taxes should you hit it big.

#  Sports Gambling Taxes Could Reach 25%

States could soon impose a 25 percent tax on gambling winnings of more than $5,000 from sports betting, under a new proposal in the U.S. Congress.

The move is an attempt to offset the cost of legalizing sports betting and regulating the industry, said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat who is sponsoring the legislation.

“It is only fair that people who benefit from this new industry help pay for its oversight and regulation,” Pallone said in a statement Wednesday.

Pallone’s proposal would also require casinos and other gambling operators to pay an 8 percent tax on their gross revenue from sports betting. The bill does not include any exemptions for fantasy sports websites such as DraftKings and FanDuel.

Casinos have been pushing for years for Congress to allow them to offer sports betting, arguing it would be a major boost to their businesses. But lawmakers have been reluctant to approve the measure, in part because of concerns about underage gambling and addiction.

The U.S. Supreme Court last month struck down a federal law that had prohibited states from allowing sports betting. Since then, several states have moved to legalize it.

New Jersey, which was at the center of the Supreme Court case, has already passed legislation imposing a 12.5 percent tax on gambling winnings of more than $500 and a 10 percent tax on operators’ gross revenue from sports betting.

#  Taxes on Gambling Could Add Millions to School Sports Budgets

States could bring in millions of dollars in new revenue from taxing gambling, and some of that money could be used to support school sports programs, a new report finds.

The report, released Thursday by the National Council of State Legislatures, estimates that states could raise $2.7 billion annually if they taxed gambling at the same rate as other taxable items.

That money “could provide significant new funding for high-school sports and extracurricular activities,” said NCSL executive director William Pound.

Currently, only four states — Nevada, Delaware, Montana and Oregon — tax gambling at rates higher than general sales taxes. West Virginia has a separate tax on gaming machines.

The report comes as many states are facing budget shortfalls. Last week, the California legislature ended its session without passing a budget, partly because lawmakers could not agree on how to address a $19 billion deficit.

In Pennsylvania,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) where state lawmakers are also struggling to pass a budget, tax increases on cigarettes and gambling have been proposed as ways to help close the shortfall.

Gambling is big business in the United States. Americans spent more than $335 billion on casino games, lotteries and other wagers in 2016, according to the American Gambling Association. That’s more than they spent on movies, video games and music combined.

State legislatures have been reluctant to raise taxes on gambling in part because of the potential revenue losses for casinos and other businesses involved in the industry. But the NCSL report says that any new taxes on gambling would likely be levied on players rather than businesses.

#  High Tax Rates May Force Bettors Out of the Market

In a market as volatile as the one for sports betting, high tax rates may force bettors out of the market, reducing liquidity and harming economic growth.

While there is no definitive answer to how high tax rates can be before they start to impact economic growth, it is important to consider that different market participants have different capacities to absorb taxation. In particular, high tax rates on activities with low barriers to entry like sports betting may have a larger negative impact on economic growth than activities with higher barriers to entry.

Bettors are likely to react to high taxes by either reducing the amount they bet or withdrawing from the market altogether. This not only harms economic growth but also reduces the government’s ability to collect tax revenue from what is a very liquid market. The government would be better off looking at alternatives ways of raising revenue, such as by reducing wasteful spending.

#  New Jersey's Tax Plan Threatens Future of Legalized Sports Betting

New Jersey's proposed tax plan has many in the Garden State worried about the future of legalized sports betting.

The proposed plan would slap a 25% tax on sports betting revenue, which is much higher than the tax rate in other states that have legalized sports betting.

This high tax rate could jeopardize the future of legalized sports betting in New Jersey, as casinos and racetracks may not want to invest in this type of gaming if the profits are going to be taxed so heavily.

In addition to the proposed tax rate, there are also concerns about how the new plan would be implemented. The proposed bill would require casinos and racetracks to partner with the state's Atlantic City casinos in order to offer sports betting.

This requirement has many worried that it will stifle competition and limit access to legal sports betting. Some believe that it will also drive business away from Atlantic City casinos and to unregulated offshore gambling sites.

The future of legalized sports betting in New Jersey is still uncertain, but lawmakers are currently working on a new proposal that would lower the tax rate and remove the requirement to partner with Atlantic City casinos.
