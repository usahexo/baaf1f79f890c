Digital marketing comprises of all marketing efforts that use electronic devices or the internet. It has replaced traditional marketing methods and is constantly evolving.

Content marketing is a strategic approach to creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.

The goal of content marketing is to create content that your target audience will find useful and interesting. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as creating blog posts, writing articles, producing videos or podcasts, or designing infographics. The key is to produce content that is high quality and engaging for your target audience.

Once you have created your content, you need to distribute it effectively. You can publish it on your website or blog, submit it to popular article directories or social media sites, or use other online distribution channels.

Content marketing can be an effective way to attract new customers and generate leads. It can also help improve your website’s SEO ranking and drive more traffic to your website.

#  What is the third type of digital marketing?

There are three main types of digital marketing: paid, organic, and earned. Paid marketing is when you use advertising to reach your target audience.

Earned media is created when people share your content on their social media channels or mention your brand in an article or blog post.

The third type of digital marketing is called owned media. Owned media is any content that you create and control, such as your website, email newsletters, and social media profiles. Unlike paid and organic methods, which use external sources to create content, owned media uses internal resources. This gives you more control over the messaging and allows you to tailored it to your target audience.

There are several benefits of using owned media. First, it helps you build a relationship with your target audience. They will see your brand as a credible source of information and be more likely to buy from you. Second, it strengthens your brand identity. When people see your logo or hear your name mentioned in various places online, they will associate those things with your company. This can help increase brand awareness and loyalty.

Third, it increases traffic to your website. By creating high-quality content that people want to read, you can attract more visitors from search engines and social media platforms. Finally, it helps improve SEO rankings. Good SEO rankings can result in more website traffic and higher conversion rates.
