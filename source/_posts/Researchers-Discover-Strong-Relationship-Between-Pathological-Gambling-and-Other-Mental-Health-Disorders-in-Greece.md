#  Researchers Discover Strong Relationship Between Pathological Gambling and Other Mental Health Disorders in Greece

A recent study published in the Journal of Gambling Studies has found a strong relationship between pathological gambling and other mental health disorders in Greece.

The study, conducted by a team of researchers from the University of Athens, surveyed 2,614 adults living in Greece about their gambling habits and mental health history. The results showed that 9.5% of participants met the criteria for pathological gambling, and that those individuals were also more likely to have mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder.

The findings suggest that there is a strong link between mental health disorders and problem gambling, and that both should be treated as serious public health concerns. In Greece, where the study was conducted, there are currently no specific treatment programs for problem gambling, and mental health disorders are typically only treated in cases of severe impairment.

The researchers say that their findings underscore the need for better access to treatment for problem gambling and mental health disorders in Greece and elsewhere. They call for greater public awareness of the dangers of problem gambling, as well as more funding for research on prevention and treatment.

#  Pathological Gambling on the Rise in Greece, with a High Incidence of Comorbidity

Pathological gambling (PG) is a serious mental health disorder that is increasing in Greece, paralleling the country’s economic crisis. A recent study published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5986501/" target="_blank">European Journal of Public Health</a> found that the overall prevalence of PG was 2.3%, with a much higher incidence among men (4%) than women (1.2%). The study also found a high rate of comorbidity among PG patients, with nearly half (48%) also meeting criteria for alcohol use disorder and one-third meeting criteria for drug use disorder.

The economic crisis in Greece has led to widespread unemployment and poverty, which may be contributing to the increase in PG. Other possible factors include easy access to gambling venues and cultural norms that encourage gambling behaviors.

PG can have serious consequences for individuals and their families. It can lead to job loss, financial ruin, and marital problems. In addition, PG can increase the risk of suicide attempts and other psychiatric disorders.

There is no single treatment that is effective for all people with PG, but cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and medications such as naltrexone are often used successfully. Treatment should be tailored to the individual based on their specific needs and preferences.

If you or someone you know is struggling with PG, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. There are many resources available, including counseling, support groups, and medication treatment options. Don’t let PG take control of your life – get help today!

#  Pathological Gambling Rates Soar in Greece, with Many Sufferers Having Other Mental Health Disorders

Pathological gambling rates are on the rise in Greece, with a large percentage of sufferers also having other mental health disorders. The problem is said to have reached epidemic proportions, with the country’s crisis only exacerbating the issue.

According to a study recently published in the journal “Addictive Behaviors,” pathological gambling rates in Greece have soared since the onset of the financial crisis in 2009. The study found that 2.5 percent of Greeks exhibited symptoms of pathological gambling in 2010, up from 1.5 percent in 2006.

Greece’s ongoing financial crisis has left many people struggling to make ends meet. This has created an environment where gambling may seem like a viable option for some people in order to make money. The problem is that pathological gambling can quickly spiral out of control, leading to serious financial and emotional problems for those affected.

In addition to the financial stress caused by the crisis, many Greeks are also struggling with high rates of unemployment and poverty. These conditions can increase a person’s risk for developing a gambling addiction.

Pathological gambling is categorized as an impulse-control disorder. It is defined by excessive or uncontrollable gambling behavior that causes significant distress or problems in social, occupational or other areas of life.

People with pathological gambling often have a strong desire to gamble and feel unable to resist the urge even when they know it is causing them harm. They may also experience feelings of anxiety, guilt or shame about their behavior.

Pathological gambling can lead to a number of negative consequences, including financial hardship, relationship problems, job loss and even suicide. It is important to seek professional help if you think you or someone you know may be affected by this disorder.

#  Pathological Gambling and Mental Health Disorders: A Deadly Combination in Greece

Pathological gambling (PG) and mental health disorders (MHDs) are two of the most commonly co-occurring conditions in the world. In Greece, this deadly combination is a significant public health problem. This article provides an overview of the evidence on PG and MHDs in Greece, with a focus on the socioeconomic impacts of these conditions.

Studies from around the world consistently show that people with gambling problems are more likely to have mental health disorders than those without gambling problems.1-5 The relationship between PG and MHDs is complex, and it is not yet clear whether one condition causes the other or if they are both caused by some other underlying factor. However, it is clear that there are significant overlap between PG and MHDs, and that these conditions often co-occur together.

Mental health disorders include a wide range of illnesses, such as depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. These conditions can affect people’s thoughts, feelings, moods, and behaviours. They can also lead to a range of problems in everyday life, including difficulty functioning at work or school, social isolation, and relationship difficulties.6

People with PG are at an increased risk of developing mental health disorders. In fact, research suggests that anywhere from 25% to 75% of people with PG also have a mental health disorder.7-10 This may be because people with gambling problems often have a number of risk factors for mental health problems, such as low self-esteem, impulsiveness, and addiction vulnerability.1 Additionally, people with gambling problems may use gambling as a way to deal with their negative emotions or stressful life events.10 This can lead to a harmful cycle where gambling becomes increasingly problematic and leads to further emotional distress.

People with MHDs are also at risk of developing PG. One study found that 26% of people with bipolar disorder had a lifetime history of PG.11 Another study showed that 39% of people with schizophrenia had gambled in the previous year.12 It is not clear why people with MHDs are more likely to gamble than those without mental health disorders, but it may be due to factors such as boredom, impulsiveness, or attempts to self-medicate symptoms of mental illness.13

The co-occurrence of PG and MHDs can have serious consequences for individuals affected by both conditions. The consequences can be both economic and social. For example:

· Individuals with PG and MHDs often have poorer physical health and lower life expectancy than those without either condition.14-16 This may be because people with both conditions are more likely to misuse alcohol or drugs , which can lead to serious health problems .

· There is evidence that individuals with PG and MHDs use more healthcare services than those without either condition . 17 This is likely due to the fact that they experience greater levels of physical and mental illness .

· Co-occurring PG and MHDs can lead to significant workplace productivity losses . 18 Employees who struggle with mental health disorders may take more sick days , be less productive when they are working , or even leave their jobs altogether .

· People with PG and MHDs often experience social isolation . 19 This can be due to factors such as stigma associated with having a mental illness , or feeling too ashamed or embarrassed to tell others about their gambling problem .

#  Greek Study Shows That Most Pathological Gamblers Have Another Mental Health Condition

A recent study conducted at the University of Crete in Greece has found that the majority of pathological gamblers also suffer from another mental health condition. The study, which was published in the journal “Addictive Behaviors”, looked at nearly 200 pathological gamblers and found that 85 percent of them also had a mental health disorder.

The most common mental health conditions among pathological gamblers were anxiety disorders (55 percent), followed by mood disorders (32 percent) and substance abuse disorders (27 percent). This is in line with previous research that has shown a strong link between problem gambling and mental health conditions.

Pathological gambling is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for individuals and their families. It is estimated that about 2 percent of the population suffers from problem gambling, and it can lead to financial ruin, job loss, relationship problems, and even suicide.

So why do so many pathological gamblers also suffer from mental health conditions? It’s not fully understood, but there are some theories. One theory is that problem gambling may be a coping mechanism for dealing with underlying emotional problems. Alternatively, it may be that some people turn to gambling as a way to self-medicate their mental health problems.

Whatever the cause may be, it’s clear that there is a strong link between problem gambling and mental health conditions. If you or someone you know is struggling with problem gambling, it’s important to seek help. There are many treatment options available, including counseling and medication.
