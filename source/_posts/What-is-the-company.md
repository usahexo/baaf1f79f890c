#  How popular are they?

Social media platforms are among the most popular and commonly used internet tools. The Pew Research Center’s 2016 report indicates that almost two-thirds of American adults use social media. In the teenage demographic, that number is even higher with more than 90% of teenagers using social media. While there are many social media platforms available, not all are equal in terms of popularity. The most popular social media platforms used by American adults include Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn.

Facebook continues to be the most popular social media platform with nearly 74% of American adults using it in 2016, down from 79% in 2015. In addition, 71% of online Americans use Facebook as their primary source for news. YouTube is the second most popular platform with almost half of American adults using it in 2016. Slightly more women (51%) use YouTube than men (49%). Instagram is the third most popular platform with 32% of American adults using it in 2016, up from 28% in 2015. Pinterest follows with 29% of American adults using it in 2016, up from 25%. LinkedIn rounds out the top five platforms with 25% of American adults using it in 2016. 

The popularity of these five platforms varies greatly by age group. For example, Snapchat is very popular among teenagers with 82% using it in 2016 but only 18% of adults aged 65 and older use it. Conversely, usage of LinkedIn increases significantly with age; 45% of Americans aged 50-64 use LinkedIn compared to only 25% of those aged 18-29.

#  Is it just for sports fans?

For over 100 years, the sport of boxing has been one of the most popular and controversial sports in the world. It seems to always be in the news for one reason or another. But is it just a sport for fans? Or is there something more to it?

 boxers are some of the most physically fit athletes in the world. They must maintain a high level of conditioning year-round to be successful in the ring. In addition to being in great shape, they must also have quick reflexes and be able to think on their feet.

mental toughness is another important attribute for a boxer. They must be able to take a punch and keep moving forward. A fighter who is mentally strong will usually be more successful than one who is not.

boxing can be a very lucrative sport as well. Many boxers make millions of dollars per fight. And with pay-per-view sales, sponsorship deals, and other income sources, they can make quite a bit of money over their career.

So, while boxing may seem like just a sport for fans, there is actually much more to it than that. Boxers must have great physical fitness, mental toughness, and business acumen to be successful.
