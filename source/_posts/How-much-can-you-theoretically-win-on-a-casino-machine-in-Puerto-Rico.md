However, it's important to remember that not every spin will result in the maximum payout - in fact, the vast majority of spins will result in lower payouts.

That said, if you're lucky enough to hit the jackpot on a machine with the maximum payout percentage, you could theoretically walk away with thousands (or even millions) of dollars. So, if you're feeling lucky, head on over to your nearest casino and see if you can strike it rich!
