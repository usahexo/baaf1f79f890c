#  TX Officials Blast Coushatta Casino Gambling as 'Illegal'

The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana has been in the news a great deal lately, and not for good reasons. The tribe's casino has come under fire from state officials, who argue that the gambling is illegal.

The Coushatta Tribe has been around for centuries, and their casino has been operational since 1990. The site offers a variety of gaming options, including blackjack, poker, and slots. It's become a popular destination for gamblers from all over the region.

But now the casino is in trouble. In a statement released this week, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry blasted the tribe's gambling operation as illegal. He argued that the casino was violating state law by offering games like blackjack and poker.

Landry also accused the tribe of failing to pay taxes on its gambling revenues. He threatened to take legal action against the tribe if they don't "come into compliance with State law."

Tribal leaders have responded to the accusations, insisting that their casino is in full compliance with state and federal law. They argue that their sovereignty grants them the right to offer gambling services on their land.

The battle between the tribe and state officials is likely to continue for some time. In the meantime, it's unclear what will happen to the Coushatta Casino. Its future remains in doubt.

#  Coushatta Casino Gambling Could be Shut Down in TX

The Coushatta Casino, located in Kinder, Louisiana, could be forced to close its doors due to gambling violations.

According to the LA Times, the casino is one of nine gaming establishments in Texas that are facing termination of their licenses for allegedly violating state gambling rules.

Texas gambling regulators sent a letter to the Coushatta Casino on Monday, notifying them of the pending closure. The letter reportedly states that the casino "knowingly violated" state law by allowing electronic gaming machines that offer cash payouts.

A spokesperson for the Coushatta Casino said that they are currently reviewing the allegations and have not yet decided whether or not they will contest the closure.

This is not the first time that the casino has faced trouble with Texas gambling regulators. In 2012, the casino was fined $5 million for similar violations.

#  TX Wants to Shut Coushatta Casino Down for 'Gambling Violations'

The state of Texas is seeking to shut down the Coushatta Casino Resort in Kinder, Louisiana, for what it alleges are “gambling violations.”

According to a report from the Associated Press, the Texas Attorney General’s Office has filed a motion in federal court seeking to enjoin the casino from continuing to operate its electronic gaming devices.

In a statement, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said that the casino was illegally allowing gamblers to use their phones and other devices to play games like blackjack and poker.

“Gambling at casinos is illegal in Texas, and this casino is blatantly violating the law,” Paxton said.

Coushatta Casino Resort officials have not yet commented on the matter.

#  Officials Seek to Close Coushatta Casino over Gambling Charges

Louisiana officials have vowed to shutter the Coushatta Casino Resort over allegations of illegal gambling by the casino's management.

The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana owns and operates the casino, and state Attorney General Jeff Landry has alleged that the resort engaged in "numerous criminal activities" related to gambling, including racketeering and money laundering.

Landry also claims that the casino hired individuals with criminal records to operate its gaming operations.

"This is not how we do business in Louisiana," Landry said in a statement. "Illegal activity will not be tolerated."

In a letter to the tribe, Landry demanded that the casino be closed immediately and that its gaming licenses be revoked.

The tribe has denied all of the allegations and said it will fight to keep the casino open.

"We stand behind our team and our world-class gaming operation," said tribal chairman George Catching. "We are confident that we will be vindicated."

It's unclear what will happen next, but it seems likely that a legal battle is imminent.

#  TX Moves to Shut Down Coushatta Casino over Illegal Gambling

The Texas Attorney General's office has filed a motion to shut down the Coushatta Casino Resort in Kinder, Louisiana, due to its illegal gambling activities.

The Coushatta Casino Resort is owned and operated by the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, a federally recognized tribe. The casino has been in operation since 2004, and employs over 1,000 people.

The Texas Attorney General's office began an investigation into the casino's illegal gambling activities in early 2018. The office alleges that the casino has been illegally offering electronic gaming machines since it opened in 2004.

Under Louisiana law, only charitable organizations are allowed to operate electronic gaming machines. The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana is not a charitable organization.

In its motion to shut down the casino, the Texas Attorney General's office argues that the casino is violating both state and federal law. The office is seeking an injunction to shut down the casino, as well as damages totaling $15 million.

The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana has not yet commented on the motion to shut down the casino.
